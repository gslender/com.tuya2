## Device details

Please provide us with some information about the device, e.g. the manufacture's website.

## Device specification

We will need some information about your device. To retrieve, please:

  - Make sure you have the latest version of the Tuya Homey App installed
  - Open https://my.homey.app using a laptop/desktop
  - Add your device if you didn't already
  - Open its settings and copy the specifications from the "Device Specification" setting
  - Paste the value below

The device specification will look like `{ "device": ..., "specifications": ..., 'data_points': ...}`. If it shows `<not available>` you can either re-add your device, or add it as other/unknown to retrieve the correct value.
