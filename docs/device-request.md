# Device request

You have found a device that we do not support yet. That's great! You can request support, but please provide us with the information noted below and make sure to send one device per request.

Also, please check whether support might have already been requested! See our [requested categories](./requested-categories.md).

> Note: when this information is missing or incorrect we cannot process your request and we will be forced to close it!

## Device details

Please provide us with some information about the device, e.g. the manufacturer's website.

## Device specification

We will need some information about your device. To retrieve this, please:

  - Make sure you have the latest version of the Tuya Homey App installed
  - Open https://my.homey.app using a laptop/desktop
  - Add your device if you didn't already (you can always use the "other" category)
  - Open its settings and copy the specifications from the "Device Specification" setting

⚠️ Please do not use screenshots for this value! We need it in text form to be able to process it.

The device specification will look like `{ "device": ..., "specifications": ..., 'data_points': ...}`. If it shows `<not available>` you can either re-add your device, or add it as other/unknown to retrieve the correct value.
